# Decentralized Secure Cloud Storage Using Blockchain Technology

Our project, "Decentralized Secure Cloud Storage using Blockchain Technology," leverages React.js, Solidity, Ethereum, and Web3.js to create a highly secure decentralized cloud storage system. By integrating cloud storage with blockchain technology, we offer robust security for file storage. Files are split and encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms, then distributed across blockchain blocks. Solidity smart contracts manage secure transactions within the system. The architecture details the integration of cloud and blockchain processes, ensuring protection against attacks such as brute force.
